# A vanilla javascript todo app

This is my attempt to make a simple todo app with vanilla js

Extra-packages like vite only exists to enhance dev experience

## Running the app locally

Step 1: clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/joeltheai/todo-vanilla
```
Step 2: change directory

```
cd todo-vanilla
```

Step 3: install packages and run the dev server


```
npm i

npm run dev
```
